# üöÄ Hostinger Deployment Path Diagnostics

## Common Hostinger Directory Structures:

1. **Standard Setup:**
   - Domain points to: `/public_html/`
   - Deploy to: `/public_html/`

2. **Subdomain Setup:**
   - Domain points to: `/public_html/subdomain/`
   - Deploy to: `/public_html/subdomain/`

3. **Multiple Domains:**
   - Primary domain: `/public_html/`
   - Secondary domains: `/public_html/domain.com/`

4. **Custom Setup:**
   - Domain points to: `/domains/yourdomain.com/public_html/`
   - Deploy to: `/domains/yourdomain.com/public_html/`

## Current Deployment Status:
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions: SUCCESS
- ‚ùå Website Access: 404 Page Not Found
- üîç Deploy Path: `/public_html/`

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check if files are deployed:**
   Visit: https://aayushmishra.tech/test-deploy.txt

2. **Check domain configuration in Hostinger:**
   - Go to Hostinger Control Panel
   - Check "Domains" section
   - Verify which folder your domain points to

3. **Common fixes:**
   - Change deploy path to `/domains/aayushmishra.tech/public_html/`
   - Change deploy path to `/public_html/aayushmishra.tech/`
   - Change deploy path to `/` (root directory)

## Alternative Deployment Paths to Try:

```yaml
# Option 1: Root directory
server-dir: /

# Option 2: Domain-specific folder
server-dir: /domains/aayushmishra.tech/public_html/

# Option 3: Subdomain-style
server-dir: /public_html/aayushmishra.tech/

# Option 4: Alternative public folder
server-dir: /htdocs/

# Option 5: WWW folder
server-dir: /www/
```

## Current Error Analysis:
The error page shows Hostinger's default 404, which means:
- ‚úÖ Domain is correctly connected to Hostinger
- ‚ùå Files are not in the directory the domain is looking for
- üîç Need to find the correct deployment path

---
**Next Steps:** Check Hostinger control panel for the correct domain path or try alternative deployment directories.
