# ðŸ”§ Hostinger Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issue:**
- GitHub Actions deployment may not be connecting to Hostinger FTP
- Domain aayushmishra.tech might not be properly configured
- Site not loading after deployment

## âœ… **Steps to Fix:**

### **1. Verify GitHub Secrets (CRITICAL)**
Go to: https://github.com/Aayush-Mishraa/MasterPortfolio-DevSculptedBy-AayushMishra/settings/secrets/actions

**Required Secrets:**
- âœ… `FTP_HOST` - Your Hostinger FTP server
- âœ… `FTP_USERNAME` - Your FTP username  
- âœ… `FTP_PASSWORD` - Your FTP password
- âœ… `FTP_PORT` - Usually `21` or `990`

### **2. Check Hostinger Panel Configuration**

#### **A. Domain Setup:**
1. Login to Hostinger hPanel
2. Go to **Domains** â†’ **Manage**
3. Ensure `aayushmishra.tech` is:
   - âœ… Active
   - âœ… Pointing to your hosting account
   - âœ… DNS properly configured

#### **B. FTP Credentials:**
1. In hPanel, go to **Files** â†’ **FTP Accounts**
2. Check your FTP details:
   - **Server:** (copy this to `FTP_HOST` secret)
   - **Username:** (copy this to `FTP_USERNAME` secret)
   - **Port:** Usually 21 (copy this to `FTP_PORT` secret)
3. Reset password if needed (copy new password to `FTP_PASSWORD` secret)

#### **C. File Manager Check:**
1. Go to **Files** â†’ **File Manager**
2. Navigate to `public_html`
3. Check if your React app files are there:
   - âœ… `index.html`
   - âœ… `.htaccess`
   - âœ… `static/` folder
   - âœ… Other React build files

### **3. DNS Propagation Check**
- Use online tools like: https://www.whatsmydns.net/
- Enter: `aayushmishra.tech`
- Check if DNS is pointing to Hostinger servers globally

### **4. Domain SSL/HTTPS Setup**
1. In Hostinger hPanel â†’ **SSL/TLS**
2. Enable SSL certificate for `aayushmishra.tech`
3. Force HTTPS redirect

### **5. Test FTP Connection Manually**
Try connecting to FTP using these credentials to verify they work:
```
Host: [Your FTP_HOST from Hostinger]
Username: [Your FTP_USERNAME]
Password: [Your FTP_PASSWORD] 
Port: [Your FTP_PORT - usually 21]
```

## ðŸ”„ **After Fixing Secrets:**

1. **Re-run GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Aayush-Mishraa/MasterPortfolio-DevSculptedBy-AayushMishra/actions
   - Click "Re-run all jobs" on the latest workflow

2. **Monitor Deployment:**
   - Watch for FTP connection success
   - Check for file upload completion
   - Verify deployment summary shows success

3. **Test Site:**
   - https://aayushmishra.tech/
   - https://aayushmishra.tech/home
   - https://aayushmishra.tech/contact

## ðŸ†˜ **If Still Not Working:**

### **Alternative: Manual Upload**
1. Download your build files from GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Upload manually via Hostinger File Manager
3. Ensure `.htaccess` is in `public_html` root

### **Contact Hostinger Support**
If FTP credentials are correct but connection fails:
- Ask about FTP server status
- Verify your hosting plan supports FTP access
- Check for any firewall restrictions
