# 🎯 FINAL SOLUTION - CORRECT FTP CONFIGURATION

## ✅ **EXACT SETTINGS FROM YOUR HOSTINGER SCREENSHOTS:**

Based on your Hostinger FTP screenshots, here are the **CORRECT** values for your GitHub secrets:

```
FTP_HOST = ftp://217.21.87.230
FTP_USERNAME = u778141320  
FTP_PASSWORD = [Your FTP password]
FTP_PORT = 21
FTP_SERVER_DIR = /public_html/          ← CHANGE FROM /htdocs/ TO /public_html/
SITE_URL = https://aayushmishra.tech
```

## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED:**

**Your GitHub Secret `FTP_SERVER_DIR` is currently set to `/htdocs/` but should be `/public_html/`**

## 📋 **ACTION STEPS:**

### 1. **Update GitHub Secret (URGENT):**
- Go to: GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Click the pencil icon next to `FTP_SERVER_DIR`
- Change from: `/htdocs/`
- Change to: `/public_html/`
- Click "Update secret"

### 2. **Deploy with Correct Path:**
Once you update the secret, the deployment will work perfectly!

## 🎯 **WHY THIS IS THE SOLUTION:**

- ✅ Your Hostinger FTP shows "Folder to upload files: **public_html**"
- ✅ Directory structure: `/home/u778141320/domains/aayushmishra.tech/public_html/`
- ✅ All other credentials are correct
- ❌ Only the directory path was wrong

## 🚀 **EXPECTED RESULT:**

After changing `FTP_SERVER_DIR` to `/public_html/`, your portfolio will be live at https://aayushmishra.tech within 3-4 minutes!
