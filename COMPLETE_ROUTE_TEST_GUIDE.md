## 🧪 **COMPREHENSIVE TEST CHECKLIST:**

### **Direct URL Access Test:**
Copy each URL below and paste directly into browser address bar:

- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/`
- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/home`
- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/experience` 
- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/education`
- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/opensource`
- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/projects`
- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/contact`
- [ ] `https://aayushmishra.tech/splash`

### **Page Refresh Test:**
Navigate to each page normally, then press **F5** or **Ctrl+R**:

- [ ] Go to `/home` → Press F5
- [ ] Go to `/experience` → Press F5  
- [ ] Go to `/education` → Press F5
- [ ] Go to `/opensource` → Press F5
- [ ] Go to `/projects` → Press F5
- [ ] Go to `/contact` → Press F5

### **Browser Back/Forward Test:**
- [ ] Navigate between pages using browser back/forward buttons
- [ ] Ensure all routes work correctly

## 📊 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

### ✅ **After .htaccess Fix:**
- All routes should load properly
- No 404 errors on direct access
- No 404 errors on page refresh
- Smooth navigation between pages

### ❌ **Before Fix (Current Issue):**
- Direct URL access shows 404
- Page refresh shows 404
- Only homepage (/) works

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

### **Route Components:**
- **`/`** → `Home` component (or `Splash` if enabled)
- **`/home`** → `HomeComponent.js`
- **`/experience`** → `Experience.js`
- **`/education`** → `EducationComponent.js`
- **`/opensource`** → `Opensource.js`
- **`/projects`** → `AllProjects.js` (not `Projects.js`)
- **`/contact`** → `ContactComponent.js`
- **`/splash`** → `Splash.js` (conditional)
- **`/*`** → `Error404.js` (catch-all)

### **Navigation Header Links:**
Your header navigation includes links to:
- Home, Education, Experience, Projects, Open Source, Contact Me

All of these should work after uploading the enhanced `.htaccess` configuration.

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Upload** the new `hostinger-deployment.zip` files
2. **Verify** `.htaccess` is in the root directory
3. **Test** all routes listed above
4. **Report** any routes that still show 404 errors

---

## 🔧 **If Any Route Still Shows 404:**

1. **Check `.htaccess` location** - Must be in `public_html` root
2. **Check file permissions** - Should be 644
3. **Contact Hostinger support** - Ask about mod_rewrite
4. **Try alternative .htaccess** configuration

The enhanced deployment package should resolve ALL routing issues for your React SPA! 🎯
