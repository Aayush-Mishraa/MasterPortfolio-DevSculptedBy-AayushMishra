# üîß Quick Deployment Verification

## The Issue Was Found ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The previous deployment was uploading an **empty index.html file**, which is why you got a 404 error even though the deployment showed "Success".

**Solution:** Rebuilt the React application properly to generate a complete index.html file with all the necessary content and assets.

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Empty index.html issue resolved  
- ‚úÖ **Pushed:** New deployment with proper build files
- üîÑ **Deploying:** GitHub Actions should be running now
- ‚è±Ô∏è **ETA:** ~5 minutes for deployment to complete

## Quick Tests to Verify:

1. **Check deployment status:** 
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab in your repository
   - Look for the latest workflow run

2. **Test the website:**
   ```
   https://aayushmishra.tech
   ```

3. **Test specific file (if needed):**
   ```
   https://aayushmishra.tech/test-deploy.txt
   ```

## If Still Not Working:

If the site still shows 404 after this deployment, it means your domain is pointing to a different directory than `/public_html/`. In that case:

1. **Use the diagnostic workflow:**
   - Go to GitHub Actions
   - Run "Diagnostic Deployment - Multiple Paths" workflow
   - Try different path options

2. **Check Hostinger control panel:**
   - Look for your domain settings
   - Check which folder it points to

## Expected Result:
Your portfolio should now load properly with all animations, content, and styling working correctly.
